## Data Storage

All data is stored using Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` API, which:
- Stores data locally on your device
- Syncs across your Chrome browsers when signed into the same Google account
- Is managed entirely by Chrome's built-in systems
- Does not involve our servers in any way

## Data Sharing

**We do not share any data with third parties** because we do not collect any data to share. Your learning progress and preferences remain entirely on your device and within your Chrome browser ecosystem.

## Third-Party Services

The extension does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs.

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests the following permissions:

### Storage Permission
- **Purpose**: To save your learning progress, preferences, and game data locally
- **Scope**: Only stores data related to the extension's functionality
- **Data**: Learning progress, settings, achievements, quiz states

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally using Chrome's secure storage API:

## Children's Privacy

This extension does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. Since we don't collect any personal data, COPPA compliance is inherently maintained.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Contact Information

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the extension's data practices, please contact:

**Developer**: Mohamed C.  
**Email**: [Your contact email]

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data, traditional data subject rights (access, portability, deletion) don't apply in the usual sense. However, you have complete control over your locally stored learning data through the extension's interface and Chrome's built-in data management tools.

## Compliance

This Privacy Policy complies with:
- Chrome Web Store Developer Policies
- General privacy best practices
- Transparency requirements for browser extensions

---

**Summary**: Your privacy is important to us. This extension operates entirely offline, stores data only on your device, and never transmits information to external servers or third parties. Your Spanish learning journey is completely private and under your control.
